No, a closed beta version of your app on the Play Store won't be visible to everyone. Here's how closed beta testing works:

Visibility:

When you set up a closed beta test on the Play Store console, you control who can access and install the beta version.
You can invite specific testers by email addresses associated with their Google Play accounts.
The beta version won't be publicly listed on the Play Store and won't be searchable by anyone.
Benefits:

Closed beta testing allows you to distribute your app to a limited group of testers for feedback before a public release.
You can use this feedback to identify and fix bugs, improve app functionality, and test the Play Install Referrer functionality in a controlled environment where testers can use specific referrer links.
Setting Up Closed Beta Testing:

Go to the Play Store Console: Access the Play Console for your app project.
Navigate to "Testing" Section: Locate the "Testing" section within the console.
Create a New Test: Click on "Create test" and choose "Closed test" as the testing type.
Configure Tester Access: Define the testing track (e.g., "Beta") and provide email addresses of your chosen testers.
Upload Beta Version: Upload the beta version of your app (APK) that includes your Google Play Install Referrer plugin.
Once the closed beta test is live:

Your invited testers will receive an email notification with instructions on how to join the beta.
They can join the beta program by following the link in the email and accessing the beta version of your app through the Play Store app on their devices.
You can monitor tester feedback and app performance within the Play Console.
Important Considerations:

There might be some limitations on the number of testers you can invite for a closed beta test (typically in the hundreds).
Ensure your chosen testers understand the beta nature of the app and are comfortable providing feedback.
Overall, a closed beta test is a valuable tool for testing your Google Play Install Referrer plugin and receiving valuable feedback in a controlled environment before a public release.


1. TestFlight:

TestFlight is Apple's official beta testing service for iOS apps.
You can use TestFlight to distribute pre-release versions of your app to a limited group of testers.
Testers can install the beta version through a link or QR code you provide.
Benefits:

Similar to closed beta testing on Play Store, TestFlight allows you to control who can access the beta version.
Testers can provide feedback and help you identify bugs and issues before public release.
Limitations:

TestFlight has a limit of 10,000 testers per app.
Testers need to use devices enrolled in the Apple Developer Program.
Setting Up TestFlight:

Go to App Store Connect: Access App Store Connect for your app project.
Navigate to "TestFlight" Section: Locate the "TestFlight" section within App Store Connect.
Create a New Test Group: Click on "New Test Group" and define the testing details.
