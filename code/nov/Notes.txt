The jsonwebtoken (JWT) library is primarily designed for server-side usage. While it can technically run in a client-side (browser) environment, it’s strongly discouraged to store and handle private keys in the client for the following reasons:

Security Risk: Placing private keys in front-end code (browser) means anyone can inspect or steal them, potentially allowing unauthorized token creation.

Best Practice: Industry standards recommend keeping private keys and signing operations on the server side (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java back end). The client typically receives already-signed tokens.

Compliance: Many regulations and corporate policies require sensitive keys to be kept in a secure environment, such as a dedicated server or HSM (Hardware Security Module), not on end-user devices.

In most architectures, jsonwebtoken is used on the server to issue (sign) and verify JWTs, while the client (browser) only reads and sends tokens. If you need JWT signing in a front-end environment, a more browser-compatible library like jose can be used, although the security considerations remain the same—exposing private keys client-side is typically a bad idea.
