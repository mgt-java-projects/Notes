LPAD stories are often larger and more complex, and in most cases, they end up being completed by the dev team only in the last 2 days of the sprint. This puts pressure on the team and results in QA receiving the items at the very last minute.

We’d like to move towards a better story breakdown — similar to how the LANO team structures their work. Their approach allows for smaller, manageable pieces to be delivered to QA earlier in the sprint, rather than pushing a bulk of the work at the end.

Adopting a similar model will help improve our delivery flow, reduce last-minute pressure, and give QA sufficient time for thorough testing.
