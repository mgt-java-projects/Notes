In some cases, leads are actively involved in story estimation, which is valuable for planning.

However, it’s important that estimations reflect the actual implementation complexity from a developer’s perspective, rather than the lead’s level of familiarity or comfort with the feature.

Estimations should consider:

The experience level of the developer(s) who will work on the story

Potential unknowns, integration points, or testing effort

Actual coding, debugging, and support time required

Aligning estimations this way ensures more accurate sprint planning and helps avoid underestimation or pressure during execution.
