I looked at our existing application and noticed that as we start implementing other flows like Credit Card, Student, etc., we may end up making multiple API calls from the UI just to fetch static page data. This could increase the number of network calls significantly as we scale.

For the EDB flow, it might seem manageable, but itâ€™s a good opportunity to optimize this early so we can leverage a better design approach for static content across all flows.

We could consider consolidating data or structuring it more efficiently to reduce repeated calls, improve performance, and keep things maintainable for the long run.

Let me know your thought
