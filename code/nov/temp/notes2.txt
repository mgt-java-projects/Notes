Hi Henry,

I will be on vacation from May 20 to June 13 to visit my family in India.

I am available to work remotely from India for one week during this period, from May 20 to May 30.
Please let me know if I get approval to carry my office laptop. If not, I will plan accordingly and not take the laptop with me.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
