Business Need & Requirement for MFE-Based Account Opening Feature
Business Requirement:
The business wants to maintain one single app in the Google Play Store & Apple App Store.
A new account opening feature needs to be developed and deployed independently without affecting the existing app.
The main hybrid app’s source code should remain unchanged, while the new feature should be a separate module.
The development teams should be able to work independently without dependencies on the main app’s deployment cycle.
A feature flag in the main app will control the activation/deactivation of the account opening module without requiring a full app update.
Future enhancements should be scalable without requiring a full app redeployment.
Why We Chose MFE (Micro Frontend Architecture)?
Micro Frontend (MFE) allows us to build and deploy the new account opening feature as an independent module while keeping the existing hybrid app intact.

Advantages of MFE in Achieving This Goal
1️⃣ Independent Development & Deployment
✅ The account opening feature can be built, tested, and deployed separately without modifying or redeploying the existing app.
✅ Different teams can work autonomously on different features.
✅ Issues with the account opening feature won’t affect the core app, reducing deployment risks.

2️⃣ Single App on Play Store & App Store
✅ The new feature is embedded into the existing app, ensuring that users still see only one app in the store.
✅ No need to launch a separate app for account opening.
✅ Business can market a unified digital experience while benefiting from modular development.

3️⃣ Feature Flag Control (On/Off Switch for Account Opening Feature)
✅ The main app has a feature flag that allows turning the account opening feature ON/OFF dynamically.
✅ If needed, the feature can be hidden/disabled instantly without requiring an app update from the store.
✅ Ensures a controlled rollout, allowing gradual releases (A/B Testing, Pilot Launch).
✅ If an issue arises, the feature can be turned off immediately without affecting other app functionalities.

4️⃣ Faster Go-to-Market
✅ Since MFE allows modular development, the account opening feature can be released quickly without waiting for changes in the main app.
✅ Reduces dependency between teams, making the process more agile.
✅ The feature flag allows staged rollouts, minimizing production risks.

5️⃣ Better Scalability & Maintainability
✅ Future enhancements (e.g., loan applications, investment features) can be built as separate MFE modules.
✅ Each module can be updated or replaced without affecting the rest of the app.
✅ With feature flags, multiple versions of the feature can be managed easily (e.g., enabling account opening for specific users first).

6️⃣ Seamless User Experience
✅ The MFE will be embedded in the same hybrid app, ensuring a consistent UI and user experience.
✅ The user won’t notice the technical separation between the core app and the new feature.
✅ With the feature flag, specific users or regions can be given early access without impacting all users.

7️⃣ Lower Risk & Better Performance
✅ Any issue with the new feature does not affect the entire app.
✅ Only the MFE module can be rolled back or updated independently.
✅ The feature flag ensures controlled rollouts, reducing risks associated with sudden feature launches.

Final Decision: Why MFE + Feature Flag is the Best Choice?
✅ One single app in Play Store/App Store, meeting business expectations.
✅ Independent feature development & deployment for faster release cycles.
✅ Scalable architecture that allows future enhancements without disrupting the core app.
✅ Minimal risk and seamless user experience, making it ideal for financial applications.
✅ Feature Flag ensures instant control, allowing safe feature rollouts and quick deactivation if needed.

This MFE approach with a feature flag ensures that account opening is a fully modular, independent, and scalable feature, while keeping everything under one unified app in the store with full control over activation.
