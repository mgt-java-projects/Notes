Hi Team,

We’ve created a dedicated Confluence page to track known technical issues that currently do not have a solution, but have been discussed with the project team.

Each item should include the following:

Full description of the issue

Summary of discussions or findings

Any context or background

Current status


Please make sure to add your items to this page as soon as a decision is made, and include complete details and technical context.

This will help us in the future if the same or similar issue arises — enabling future team members to either continue the investigation from where we left off, or close the issue based on existing decisions.

Let’s use this page as a shared knowledge base to ensure better continuity and minimize duplicate effort across the team.
