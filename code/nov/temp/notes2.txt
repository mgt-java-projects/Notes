Development has provided buffer time to support and address any observations raised during QA testing.

However, in the current sprint, the team is fully allocated to ongoing development work, leaving limited bandwidth for timely support of QA activities.

In standard Agile practice, it is generally recommended that developers reserve some buffer time within the sprint to support QA, especially during testing phases toward the end of the sprint. This ensures that:

Bugs and observations can be resolved promptly.

QA is not blocked or delayed.

The Definition of Done is met consistently across stories.

If all developers are fully stretched on new development tasks, it can create a bottleneck for QA, potentially leading to spillovers or lower story completion rates.

It may be helpful to consider allocating a portion of dev capacity specifically for QA support and stabilization, especially in the second half of the sprint.
