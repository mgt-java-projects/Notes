When running in Micro Frontend (MFE) mode, Angular considers the parent application's angular.json configuration for build-related constraints like maximumError.

Here’s how it works:

Parent Application (maximumError: 20MB)

Since the parent application is the shell that loads the child MFE, its angular.json settings take precedence during runtime when both are running together.
Angular’s build and performance budgets are applied at the level where the build happens. Since the parent loads the child MFE dynamically, the parent's budget configuration (20MB) is the effective limit.
Child MFE (maximumError: 12MB)

When built separately, the child project adheres to its own angular.json settings (12MB).
However, once integrated into the parent in MFE mode, the child’s bundle becomes part of the overall application runtime and is subject to the parent’s performance budget.
Conclusion:
In MFE mode, the parent’s maximumError setting of 20MB will be considered for the entire application at runtime, including the dynamically loaded child MFE.
