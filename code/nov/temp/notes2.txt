Implement changes in the True IDV MFE repository to navigate back to the Launch UI repository using the following endpoint:

{
  Status: <status_code>,
  Application_id: <application_id>
}

Success: Indicates IDV was completed successfully.

Error: Skip returning to launch, due to validation failure, timeout, or other issues.

Enhance the true-idv-page-handover component to display a spinner and retry key adjudication logic by invoking the adjudication API to fetch the current status.


Response Handling in Launch UI:

Success:

Re-initiate the KYC adjudication API.

If adjudication succeeds:

Proceed with account opening success logic.

Redirect to the Branch UI.

Error:

Option 1:
Re-initiate the KYC adjudication API. If adjudication fails, fallback to:

Redirect to the Branch UI.

Option 2 (Default):

Directly redirect to the Branch UI.
