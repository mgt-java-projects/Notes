Hi [PO's Name],

To support better planning and alignment within the Agile team, could you please walk us through the Launch Pilot scope (LPAD + LANO)?

It would be helpful to understand:

What is the full scope of the pilot assigned to the Launch team?

What has been completed so far, and what is still pending?

Epic list with estimated sizes, if available

Tentative release timeline and number of sprints remaining

This will help the team stay aligned and ensure we're focused on the right priorities as we move forward.
