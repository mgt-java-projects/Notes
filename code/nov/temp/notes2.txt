Hi Vijay,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing the context.

I’d be happy to connect and walk you through the MFE integration approach we’ve used for the Launch implementation on CDB. I’m available today at 2:30 PM for a quick discussion—please feel free to send a meeting invite at your convenience.
